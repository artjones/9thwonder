      <h1>About 9th Wonder</h1>

      <p class="intro-lead">
        9th Wonder is a working tattoo and art studio built around peace,
        professionalism, and respect for the creative process.

  <!-- ABOUT PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section class="manifesto">
    <div class="manifesto-inner">

      <p>
        Tattooing is the foundation of 9th Wonder. We take walk-ins, book
        appointments, and work every day. The studio operates as a professional
        environment where craft, discipline, and consistency come first.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe peace is essential to meaningful work. Peace does not mean
        silence or restriction — it means creating a space where focus is
        protected and creative thought is uninterrupted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond tattooing, 9th Wonder exists as an environment for making. Artists
        are welcome to come create, experiment, and build — whether through
        drawing, painting, design, writing, or technical exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        We honor tattooing as a craft and a field of study. This includes not
        only application, but the mechanics, materials, and experimentation
        behind the tools themselves.
      </p>
